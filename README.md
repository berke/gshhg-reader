GSHHG is a "high-resolution geography data set, amalgamated from two
databases: World Vector Shorelines (WVS) and CIA World Data Bank II
(WDBII)", see https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/

The files are provided as ESRI shapefiles and in a native binary
format.

The native binary format is pretty simple and documented here:

This is a loader for this binary format.
